# Project Title

Connetion Machine LED 

## Description

To bring together and evolve the many components and orphaned / hidden code bases that are used to drive LED Displays in the 'pleasing' pattern common to the thinking machine CM5 or famous WOPR
I'll evolve this description as it moves from being a safe place to bring together code before it is lost 

## Getting Started

Just a dumping ground of scattered code at the moment, so nothing to actually get started with

### Dependencies

Current the code only works on a Pico type board that supports micropython 

* MicroPython 1.6D
* PicoZero (or alternative relavant to hardware) 
* Max7219 library - https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-max7219

### Installing

I'll write s quick summary on how to put it on the PICO for anyone who wants a tinker but little point at the moment

* TODO

### Executing program

Pico boot.py process - I"ll write it up, but as the scope is to move it away from PICO little value

* TODO to run the program
```
code blocks for commands
```

## Help

it works, as the scope is defined, help and support will be clearerA
```
command to run if program contains helper info
```

## Authors

Contributors names and contact info

Current Contributors indirectly (I just took their initial work as a starting point) are 
ex. [Mike Causer] (https://github.com/mcauser) Wrote the LED Python Driver
ex. aforsberg - I've not found a huge ammount about this person beyond their iniital code and their 3d printing projects, love to credit this person more

## Version History

* DEV
    * Centralised the codebase

## License

At present this code is not mine, I've not made any alternations, so please do with it as you will, I've done my best to honour any requests I've found of the original authors or their chosen license

## Acknowledgments

Inspiration, code snippets, etc.
